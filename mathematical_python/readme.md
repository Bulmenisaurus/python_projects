### ⚠️⚠️ SPOILER WARNING ⚠️⚠️
#### Do NOT look at any of these projects if you haven't solved them yet, as that could ruin all the fun.
##### Proceed with caution

This are my solutions for a cool programming website called [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/).
The solutions sometimes are really out of the box, and hopefully I can rack up more and more solved puzzles!
