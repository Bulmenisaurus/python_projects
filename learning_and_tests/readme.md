# learning_and_tests

This is for learning new things in python, such as [classes](https://github.com/Bulmenisaurus/python_projects/blob/master/learning_and_tests/classes.py), or just smaller parts of another project.
Don't expect fully fledged projects to pop up here, but there are some pretty cool ones.
