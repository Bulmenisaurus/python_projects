# major_projects

These are usually projects which require multiple files, and can be on many random themes. Since these are massively 
confusing, I'll explain each project below:

| Name                    | Description                                                                                                                              |
|:------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `corrupter_of_images`   | This project takes any file and corrupts it, by replacing some bytes here and there.                                                     |
| `minecraft_textures`    | This project combines any two minecraft textures into a single image. You can view some results at (generated_images)[https://github.com/Bulmenisaurus/python_projects/tree/master/major_projects/minecraft_textures/generated_images]|
| `of_the_day`            | Here, a python webscraper scrapes the web for some day-specific things, such as a quote of the day and combines it into an html file.    |
| `scratch_bot`           | A __kinda__ failed attempt at creating a [scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) bot that can perform actions such as liking, favoriting, etc.|
| `text_adventure`        | A __very__ failed attempt at a text adventure that I lost motivation for. :Â¬(                                                            |
| `universal_secret_codes`| Some obfuscated and un-obufscated .py files to encode and decode messages. Obfuscating is HARDDD!                                        |


I hope you look through some of them!
