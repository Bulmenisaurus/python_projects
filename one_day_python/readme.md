# one_day_python

Do you ever get an idea to do something in python, and challenge yourself to do it in a time period? Well,
every single one of these files was made in 1 day!<sup>1</sup> The projects I am most probably proud of is 
[obfuscated_hello_wrld.py](https://github.com/Bulmenisaurus/python_projects/blob/master/one_day_python/obfuscated_hello_wrld.py)!



1. Of course, sometimes I edited the files **after** one day has passed, but still, the bulk of the code is written during that day.
