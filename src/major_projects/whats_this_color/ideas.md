> â€“ Me, 2020

1. Google search results for hex search (How popular is it?)

2. Conversions to different formats [rgb, cmyk, hsb&hsv, etc]

3. Use Apis to automate to some of the process
    1. [Colornames](https://colornames.org/download/), for names of colors
    2. [thecolorapi](https://www.thecolorapi.com/), for everything else
    
4. Get invert, and darkness of that color in multiple ways to compare

5. Color picked embed for that color

6. use https://encycolorpedia.com/691123 for important info
