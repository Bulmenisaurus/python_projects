# APIS

This folder is for my projects involving [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), or an 
**application programming interface**. For some great public APIs, look at the resources below.

 - A list of [public apis](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis), great for basic-advanced projects.
 - A great free api I've used, which involves millions of named colors: [Colornames](https://colornames.org/download/)
 
 
 I hope you enjoy some of my projects involving these cool little things! :)
